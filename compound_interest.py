# Formula to calculate compound interest annually is given by:
# A = P(1 + R/100) t
# Compound Interest = A â€“ P
# Where,
# A is amount
# P is principle amount
# R is the rate and
# T is the time span

    a = p*pow((1+(r/100)), t)

time_period = int(input('Enyer Tenure: '))

total_compoundInterest = total_return - principal_amount

print('Your Principal Amount: ' + str(principal_amount))
